# Web-Design-Challenge

A website created to house the findings from a previous weather project.  This site boasts:

* A responsive navigation pane with working hamburger links, and dropdown menu

* Multiple pages to demonstrate data found

* A sidebar with preview thumbnails linked to their respective summary page

* Bootstrap components for a simple and clean layout that can be used and understood by anyone coming to the site

* A "Data" page that houses the actual source data table pulled from the API in our previous project
